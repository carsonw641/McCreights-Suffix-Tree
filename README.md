# McCreights-Suffix-Tree
McCreight's suffix tree implementation for my Bioinformatics class.

This implementation was modeled from Juha K채rkk채inen, a CS professor at the Univerity of Hellsinki; in particular, K채rkk채inen's eighth lecture on Suffix Trees and Arrays, which includes the pseudo-code I modeled for my implementation. The link to his presentation can be found here: https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/tpkarkka/teach/15-16/SPA/lecture08.pdf. I found his slides and pseudo-code much easier to follow compared to others that I came across through my research. 

Other references that I used along the way to better my understanding of McCreights Algorithm can be found in the links below (including McCreights official research paper on this suffix tree algorithm):

My code is pretty simple in terms of its functionality. At it's current state, it purely accepts some input and processes that into the suffix tree. It then prints the structure out in a somewhat readable output format and clears the tree. This could be built upon to add functionality for suffix lookups and other functionality that suffix trees provide.
